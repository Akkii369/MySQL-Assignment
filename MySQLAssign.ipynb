    "\n",
    "SQL Databases (Relational Databases):\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure: SQL databases are structured and use tables to organize data. Each table is defined with a schema that includes columns and data types.\n",
    "Query Language: They use SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing data.\n",
    "ACID Compliance: They support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties to ensure reliable transactions.\n",
    "Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.\n",
    "NoSQL Databases (Non-relational Databases):\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure: NoSQL databases can store data in various formats such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or columns.\n",
    "Query Language: They use various query languages or APIs, not necessarily SQL.\n",
    "Scalability: They are designed for horizontal scaling and are often used for large-scale applications with unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "Examples: MongoDB (document-based), Redis (key-value), Cassandra (column-family), Neo4j (graph-based)."
